              Hipparchus 1.7 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-1.7

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release.

It fixes several bugs, including a nasty one in ODE events handling, improves a lot
the Complex class so it implements the new CalculusFieldElement interface, and adds
several new differentiation classes to handle simpler cases (univariate derivatives
at orders 1 and 2 and gradients) with less overhead than the existing DerivativeStructure.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/97:  Added ExtendedUnivariateDifferentiableVectorFunction interface
              for differentiable vectorial function. 
o             Added intermediate interface {Field}Derivative.
              The interface is implemented by both {Field}DerivativeStructure, {Field}Gradient,
              {Field}UnivariateDerivative1and {Field}UnivariateDerivative2 
o issues/95:  Added new mathematical methods for FieldGradient,
              FieldUnivariateDerivative1 and FieldUnivariateDerivative2. 
o issues/92:  Added isMathematicalInteger to Complex. 
o             Added isMathematicalInteger to Precision for double and float numbers. 
o issues/93:  Added UnivariateDerivative1, UnivariateDerivative2 and Gradient
              for computing derivatives in simple cases with less overhead than
              DerivativeStructure. 
o issues/81:  Added map and mapToSelf to RealMatrix. 
o             Added Dfp conversion to either larger or smaller number of digits. 
o issues/78:  Add Line.fromDirection(...). 
o             Added Complex.pow(int n) with integer power computed more accurately by
              successive squarings rather than complex logarithm and exponential. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/94:  Fix infinite loop in event handling when a RESET_STATE or RESET_DERIVATIVES event
        causes two other event detectors to trigger simultaneously and discontinuously at
        the same time. Thanks to Mikael. 
o issues/71:  Don't ignore exceptions, use try with resources. 
o issues/91:  Fixed accuracy of linear combination for Dfp. 
o issues/88:  Fixed handling of special cases in Dfp.atan2(y, x). 
o issues/87:  Prevent overflow of Dfp.hypot. 
o issues/86:  Fixed Dfp.floor and Dfp.ceil for numbers close to zero. 
o issues/82:  Fixed Decimal64.rootN for negative arguments and even roots. 
o issues/77:  Provide both L_1 and L_infinity norms for matrices. 
o issues/76:  Fixed MathArrays.linearCombination when signed zeros are involved. 
o issues/74:  Fixed Complex.pow(Complex p) and Complex.pow(double p) for special cases
              (real arguments, integer power, 0). 
o issues/63:  Added signum to Fraction and BigFraction. 
o             Prevent random failure of micro-sphere test case. 

Changes:
o issues/72:  Changed RotationOrder from final class to enum.
